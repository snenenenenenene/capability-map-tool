### Background

A [capability map](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-business-capability-maps) is a visual representation of an organization's capabilities and the relationships between them. It is a useful tool for identifying areas of strength and weakness, as well as potential areas for improvement.

The Capability Map Tool uses a procedural generation algorithm to automatically create capability maps based on user-defined parameters. Users can specify the number of capabilities, the number of levels in the map hierarchy, and the types of relationships between capabilities.

### Installation

To use the Capability Map Tool, you will need to have [Java 8 or later](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer.

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/snenenenenenene/capability-map-tool.git
```

- Navigate to the backend directory and run the Spring Boot application:
```bash
cd capability-map-tool/backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

- In another terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory and execute the React run command:
```bash
cd capability-map-tool/frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Usage

To use the Capability Map Tool, you will need to provide it with a set of inputs. These inputs should describe the capabilities of the system or organization you are analyzing.
